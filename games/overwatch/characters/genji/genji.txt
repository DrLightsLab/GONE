            Notes:
                1: Aiming Dragonblade upwards increases the size of the hitbox.
                    Theory 1:  The hitbox is increased so much that it will hit enemies that aren't visible during a double jump.
                        Test:  Determine max range for hitbox when aiming up and then test if it stills hits during a double jump.
                            This will be accomplished with the following steps:
                                (1) Slash upward (miss)
                                (2) Move forward
                                (3) Slash upward (hit)
                                (4) Slash forward (miss)
                                (5) Double jump and slash downward (miss)
                                (6) Double Jump and slash upward (hit?)
                            This will also determine whether or not the hitbox is extended while aiming downward.
                        Results:  Confirmed.  Step 6 was a hit while step 4 & 5 were misses.  The hitbox is only extended while aiming upwards,
                            and it will hit enemies that aren't even visible on the screen.
                        Notes:  We now know that the hitbox is large enough to hit enemies that are standing during a double jump.  Does this mean
                            that the hitbox extends to the floor?  Another way to test the size of the extended hit box is the following:
                                (1) Perform test on smaller character (initial tests performed on training bot)
                                (2) Perform test on crouched character
                                (3) Perform test on a target that is slept by Ana
