        Sprint:
            Notes:
                Note 1: Sprint can be activated/deactivated any time except during crouching.
                    Theory: Jump sprinting can be used to escape a Mei ultimate.  This is due to the horizontal movement, which is unaffected
                        by the Mei ultimate, that Soldier gains when he sprints during a jump.
                    Test:  Have Mei use her ultimate and try to escape using jump sprinting.  The following questions will be used to
                        determine whether jump sprinting actually helps escape the ultimate and to further explain how Mei's ultimate works:
                            (1) Is regular sprinting enough to escape?
                            (2) Are grounded enemies only affected by the ultimate?
                                (2a) Are you unaffected during your jump?
                                    Expanded: Does Mei's ultimate build to freezing an enemy by a total amount of time you are affected by it?
                                        Note: The acronym TUF (Time Until Frozen) will be used to represent how long a character must be affected by
                                            Mei's ult until she is frozen. This should further expand to her Endothermic Blaster, but that is out of
                                            scope for this theory.
                                            E.G.: Jumping leaves you unaffected, but the window of time unaffected is so small that repeated jumping
                                                is enough to slow TUF but not enough to stop it.  Simply put, the character is grounded (affected) more than
                                                they are jumping (unaffected) and max TUF is reached.
                                (2b) Are grounded enemies affected by the slow more than airborne enemies?
                                    Expanded: Enemies are still affected by the ultimate even when airborne (jumping), however, they are not slowed as much
                                        as enemies who are grounded in the ultimate.
                                        E.G.: TUF is unaffected by whether the enemy is grounded or airborne, but the slowing effect of Mei's ultimate is
                                            affected by whether the enemy is grounded or airborne.
